      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I was recently a student for Sac State Nursing entering as a junior transfer. It didn't take me long to realize nursing wasn't something I wanted to do for long and, so I pivoted to Computer Science, which lead me to where I am now.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Surigao City, Philippines</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to play Volleyball outside of school, but ever since I graduated highshool I've pursued other interests in Esports. I also play the guitar and play videogames, such as the new Dark Souls game 'Elden Ring'.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't necessarily have specific dream job, although working for a game company like Riot Games would be fun.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Elk Grove, California of Sacramento County.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been curious about the creating of a website from scratch. I've entered research related competitions for Biotechnology, like the one hosted by Davis, which require the presentation of research through a website builder such as Weebly. These website builders don't require any knowledge about coding and it's simply a 'drag and drop' feature with templates, which can be restrictive. So, I've always wondered what it would be like to create a website that's only limited my own knowledge and imagination.</p>
